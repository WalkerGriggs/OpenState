## Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains architecture decision records (ADRs) for OpenState

### ADRs, generally

An ADR can be summarized as:

> In the context of <use case/user story\>, facing <concern\> we decided for <option\> to achieve <quality\>, accepting <downside\>.

For further reading on the concept: [ADR GitHub organization](https://adr.github.io/) and [Spotify R&D](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/04/14/when-should-i-write-an-architecture-decision-record/)

### ADRs, for OpenState

As far as OpenState is concerned, each ADR should:
  - enumerate each option considered, including pros, cons, and background.
  - detail the decision, proposed changes, and current state.
  - transparently and honestly describe the consequences of the decision.
  - have a changelog! No ADR should be final -- these are living documents.

Use the [ADR template](adr-000-template.md) to get started.
