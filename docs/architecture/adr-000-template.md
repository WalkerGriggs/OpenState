# ADR {Number}: {Title}

## Changelog

  - [YYYY-MM-DD] {Github Username}: {Description of change}

## Context

> This section describe the context and the problem. In 2-3 sentences, articulate the background of the problem and the current state. A new contributor should be able to read the context and understand how each considered option addresses the state problem.

## Prior Art

> If applicable, link to discussions, Issues, PRs, or existing documentation.

## Requirements

> This section lists all of the option requirements. They are broken down into 'musts' and 'ideals'.

## Musts

> Musts are requirements which are non-negotiable. Any option which does not meet these requirements should be immediately disqualified or must have significant, alternative benefits.

## Ideals

> Ideals are requirements which are "nice to have". These requirements help options stand out from the pack, but do not work against the option if absent.

## Considered Options

> This section enumerates all options. Each option should include: a 2-3 sentence description, a bulleted list of pros and cons, and a sentence stating why this option was ultimately not chosen.

## Decision

> This section describes the final decision, records relevant conversations, and details the reasons why this decision was reached.

### Consequences

> This section describes the consequences (positive, negative, and neutral) of this decision. It's important to be honest here. Not all decisions are perfect, and clearly enumerating the consequences may help ICs down the line.

### Design

> This section translates the often abstract decisions into concrete implementation details. This section isn't necessary for a new ADR, but should be backfilled once the decision is implemented.
